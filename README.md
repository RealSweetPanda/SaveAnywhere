### Notes

*This mod does not work when using mods that add locations due to the map usually. It also does not usually log NPC's
that are added to the game via mods. A fix may come in the future to solve this, but not likely for map extensions.*

*This mod is
also **semi-experimental meaning that it can crash and cause issues. This is hit or miss. PLEASE BACKUP BEFORE USING**
If you have a problem it is probably because of a mod conflict. The best experience will be with no other big mods,
Again, this doesn't always happen it's just a thing to take note of.*
